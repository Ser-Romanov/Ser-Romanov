### About me

Hi, I'm Sergei! Since May 2022 I've been studying data analytics. Previously, I was engaged in data analysis in the field of transport logistics.

To deepen my knowledge in data analysis, I took several online courses, with the help of which I mastered Python, SQL, mathematical statistics, probability theory, product metrics and frameworks for product development. On academic projects, I practiced in conducting statistical tests, creating dashboards in Tableau, using Git and Airflow.
