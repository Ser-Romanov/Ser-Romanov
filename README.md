### About me

Since May 2022 I've been studying data analytics. Earlier, I was engaged in data analysis in the field of transport logistics.
To deepen my knowledge in data analysis, I took several online courses, with the help of which I mastered Python, SQL, mathematical statistics, probability theory, product metrics and frameworks for product development. On academic projects, I practiced in conducting of statistical tests, creating dashboards in Tableau, using Git and Airflow.
